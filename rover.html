          <p>On February 19, 2021, we watched the "Perseverance rover", the largest, most advanced rover ever sent to
            another planet, as millions of people hold our breath and land on Mars. In fact, we listened to the signals
            he sent from a distance of 472 million km and received the information that it had arrived safely. I will
            not call him "perseverance" now, our sincerity increased, I will be content with simply saying "Percy". As
            soon as we landed on Mars, he started sending us very low resolution pictures. The pictures he recorded with
            the 23 cameras he sent in these 5 Mars days
            number approached 5000. So far, almost everything is as we expected. Communication was made in the same way
            as the vehicles sent before, and they also took pictures and sent them. But this time, what's sent is so
            clear
            Even the engineers working in the projed cannot believe their eyes. Now, we will first watch these clearest
            images from another planet to date, listen to the sound recorded on a planet for the first time, and most
            importantly, seek answers to the questions we are curious about.

            <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/videos/?v=461">Watching </a>
            <a>Displays the picture published by NASA. A total of 23 cameras placed on different parts of the vehicle
              were recorded during the landing, descending and landing processes. First we see the parachute that opens
              after entering the Martian atmosphere. Real-time images on the right are shown as slowed down by 30% on
              the left because they are realized very quickly. We see that the speed of the vehicle is greatly reduced
              after the parachute is opened. The bottom cover of the heat shield that protects Percy from the effects of
              entering space and atmosphere is discarded. Now the speed of the vehicle is "subsonic", that is, slower
              than the speed of sound.

          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>
              When the lower cover is opened, radar and sub cameras begin to see and examine
              the surface of Mars for the first time. The ground clearance is currently 9.5 km. The falling bottom cover
              is still the bottom left continues to appear from the corner. At this stage, the TRN (Terra Relative Navigation) vehicle, which
              consists of newly installed cameras and radars, tries to automatically determine the most suitable place
              to land.</a>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg&t=123s">At this point</a>
              <a>The other part of the outer shell to which the parachute carrying the vehicle is attached is thrown
                away. 2.6 km to the surface remained. Now Percy and the celestial crane to which he was attached began
                to approach the ground at 83 meters per second. From here on
                We see that the vehicle starts to slide itself from the rough terrain on the right to the left. The
                place to land was pinpointed and the speed dropped to 30 meters per second. With 20 meters to the
                ground, the sky crane maneuver begins. This is the first time we are watching a landing on another
                planet from three different angles. The lower left image is recorded by the winch in the upper left and
                sent to Percy by the cable wrapped in 6 meters of ropes. Percy is also recording the crane with the
                camera on the top and the Martian soil with the camera below. Currently, the crane is trying to gently
                lower the rover to the ground at a height of about 20 meters from the ground. After the lowering has
                taken place, it leaves, releasing the cables and ropes. After a while, he will end his mission by
                hitting the ground a little further. Percy reached his home where he would now live forever. Including
                our names in the chip he took with him.
                will keep alive ...</a>

              One of the things that excites me the most about this task is that the data and images are shared with the
              whole world in almost real time. In fact, a call was made to all students to examine these images shared
              at yesterday's press conference. We are now living in such a communication age that we can access
              information sent from another planet even with the phone in our pocket. Where Percy landed
              We don't just know the coordinates,

              <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/"> We can examine it on an interactive
                map. </a>

              <a>Every time I watch these images, I am not only affected by the technological success. I think they have
                a completely different feeling than we experience with rocket launches. I think it is a feeling of
                watching this high quality, high definition and simultaneously from different angles. I don't know what
                do you think, but the voice I will listen to you soon strengthens the same feeling. Percy was
                unfortunately unable to record on landing due to a technical glitch. So there is no sound recording
                accompanying these images. But after he landed, he started recording the sounds of Mars and the first

              <a> happened. The high-pitched noise we hear in the background is Percy's own voice while working. In the
                middle of the recording, we hear the sound of the wind blowing on Mars. In the second version created by
                filtering Percy's voice, this wind sound is heard much more clearly..</a>

        <h3>How were high resolution videos sent?</h3>
        <a>There is a small computer and storage unit on the Rover, called the Data Storage Unit (DSU). Nearly 30 GB of
          raw image was recorded by 6 cameras inside the Rover. With the help of the same computer, the most important
          parts were selected and compressed into small video clips. Thus, they significantly reduced the amount of data
          sent to Earth. </a>
        <a>There are three antennas above Percy. One of them is a 400 megahertz UHF antenna. It can provide fast data
          communication with satellites orbiting Mars. Distance between Rover and these satellites
          a conversation-like system with a walkie-talkie as it is so close</a>
        <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/communications/">they established.</a>
        <a>Later, these satellites send data to the world with antennas suitable for long-range communication on them.
          Deep Space Network (DSN) antennas spread across two hemispheres and three different regions of the world send
          these signals for 5 to 20 minutes depending on the size of the distance between Earth and Mars.</a>
