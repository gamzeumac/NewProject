            What would it be like to be all alone in the world…? Many TV series / movies have been shot about this. One
            of the funniest
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230454/">“The Last Man on Earth”</a>
            Something is happening as usual, we are tampering with the settings of the world, and somehow all of the
            people on earth are disappearing in this series. One
            except person. It is this story that tells about that person's struggle for survival in a post-apocalyptic
            world. This time, not terribly, but in a funny way. What good is an advanced civilization if it doesn't have
            people left in it? Alone in the empty streets
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEjIJzxmM1E"> playing bowling </a> What can you do other than punch
            holes in cars?
            The effect of this drama, which I can say is not very, but a little funny, was that it made me think
            seriously the following question: Who is the loneliest person in the world right now? Humanity does not have
            to be destroyed for this problem to be valid.
            I'm sure there is such a person; I searched the subject with the thought of someone who had asked this
            question before and indeed I found the loneliest person in the world currently alive.
            The man is sleeping under huge tropical leaves in one of the most remote corners of the world while you
            watch this video, which reaches your seat via one of the world's most advanced distribution networks, from a
            tiny screen you carry in your pocket, or a huge screen that you hang on a wall. Insects have bitten almost
            all over his half-naked body; giant flies fly around to taste his blood. Spider monkeys are running javelin
            on the top of the tree on which he rests. When he wakes up soon, he will try to hunt them to eat for
            breakfast. In order to cook it, he has to cut trees. If you listen carefully enough, you can hear the
            primitive ax swinging at the tree.
            I know it sounds like a fairy tale to you. Describing that humanity lived thousands of years ago as
            hunter-gatherer
            <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/">from such books </a> as if I was reading a passage… By
            the way, Sapiens' comic was also
            published. It's like I'm showing an imaginary drawing inside this. But no. All of what I'm telling is true.

            It is estimated that he is in his 50s. Turkey 7 lives alone in the depths of the Amazon jungle as big. He
            has not even stepped into the modern world until today. It has never come out of an area of approximately 50
            square kilometers, which it has designated as a living space.
            How do we know all this? Established to protect Amazon Indians
            <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Funda%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Nacional_do_%C3%8Dndio">Funai</a> This non-profit
            organization, which defends the rights of the indigenous people and has identified 113 different tribes
            living in isolation from the modern world so far. Most of these tribes disappear when they come into contact
            with the modern world. They die because they are not used to our illnesses and sick behaviors. That's why
            Since the 90's, some legal regulations have been introduced that protect them. Although the number of such
            tribes is very low, they still continue to struggle to exist in groups of 20-30 people. One way or another,
            20-30 people are not considered alone because they are together. But our world's loneliest man is not like
            that. Unlike the others, he is alone. We do not know the language and name he speaks. We will probably never
            learn. All we know is that he digs holes about 2 meters deep in the ground. That's why they gave him a name
            for this feature.

            <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Man_of_the_Hole"> Hole man</a>

            We don't know why he was digging these holes. There are various theories. Some claim that he set up a trap
            to hunt animals,
            <a
              href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/brazil-uncontacted-tribe-indigenous-people-amazon-video">some
              also</a>
            he claims it has a religious purpose. Far from it, Africa
            people on the continent are also starting to dig holes in the ground to revitalize the ecosystem.
            <a href="https://justdiggit.org/news/highlights-2020/">heard</a> but I don't really think that's why he's
            digging a hole where the hole man lives. We are not likely to ask him, because thanks to the measures taken
            by Funai, it is forbidden to enter his area. No other person can travel within 50 km of the loneliest man in
            the world anymore.

        Shall I tell you something more interesting than that? About 50 years ago there was another man much more lonely
        and isolated than the hole man. The loneliest person in the universe, not the world. As you can imagine, I am
        talking about an astronaut who was sent to the Moon in 1969. No, Neil Armstrong wasn't the first to set foot on
        the moon, the loneliest person. Because there was Buzz Aldrin next to him in the vehicle that landed on the
        moon. So two people landed together. They set out as three people on the module that took them to the Moon, but
        when they reached the orbit of the Moon, two people landed with the "Eagle" module, while one person stayed in
        the "Columbia" module around the Moon to wait for them. Alone. He waited for 27 hours for his friends on the
        Moon to come back. Of course, he was busy communicating with both the control center on Earth and the Moon
        during this time. But since it rotates in its orbit, when it goes to the back of the Moon, it stops
        communicating for about 50 minutes. Here's the astronaut during that 50-minute period
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)">Michael Collins</a> He earned the title of
        being a more isolated, distant, more lonely person than all people who have ever lived on earth. Think about it,
        the two closest to you are on the other side of the Moon, the rest of humanity is on Earth. I also want to add
        the title of "the most unlucky" to this. Because having to go up there, wander around the Moon for 27 hours and
        land on it while his friends pass through history, having to wait alone upstairs really makes one say "this is
        the luck".
        How big a distance is there between the hole man and this astronaut, right? Both of these people are alive now.
        In order for someone to be the loneliest person in the world, they should not go even 50 km from their
        birthplace. In order for the other to be the loneliest human being in the universe, humanity had to wait for the
        most advanced technological tools to be developed over thousands of years and travel 400,000 km with them. Two
        ends, the result of which is loneliness. But one of these two men, both still alive, was left alone knowingly
        and willingly. Although it doesn't land on the moon
        his prize was to go into the history of space. What about the other? Do you know why the hole man alone? Not
        because he chose to be that way. Once upon a time he also had a family. Although it consists of 20-30 people, it
        is a tribe. They lived in their own way, unaware of the outside world and civilization. They may not have
        discovered civilization, but civilization was quick to find the places where they lived. For a handful of land,
        they dived into the forest where they lived and destroyed that tribe along with the trees. Our hole man lost his
        entire family and tribe, everyone he knew in this world when he was just a kid in the 80's.
        I think it is more correct to call him a hole man for this reason, not because of the holes he dug into the
        ground. Because improving does not always mean progress. Sometimes many holes are opened in the heart of nature
        for this cause.
